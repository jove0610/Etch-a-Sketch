Etch-a-Sketch

This is a browser game that demonstrates DOM Manipulation. The game starts with a 16x16 Sketchpad (can be changed). When the mouse hovered any box inside the sketchpad, its background color(the small box only, not the entire sketchpad) will change to a random color. This allows you to sketch a figure.

A clear button is used to remove all the colors in the sketchpad.
